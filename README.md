Git is a powerful tool that streamlines the development process, improves collaboration, and helps maintain the integrity of your codebase.

Here are some essential Git commands:

1. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. git clone <`repository_url`>: Creates a local copy of a remote Git repository.

3. git add <`file`>: Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them for commit.

4. git add . :Adds all modified and new files to the staging area.

5. git status :Shows the current state of your repository, including tracked and untracked files, modified files, and branch information.

6. git commit -m`[descriptive message]`:commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot. 

7. git branch: Lists all local branches in the repository.

8. git branch `your_branch_name`: Creates a new branch with the specified name.

9. git checkout `your_branch_name`: Switches to the specified branch.

10. git checkout -b `your_branch_name`: Creates a new branch and switches to it in one step.

11. git push origin your_branch_name is used to push the specified branch to the remote repository named "origin". This command is typically used when you want to push a branch for the first time to the remote repository or when you have made local commits and want to synchronize your changes with the remote repository.


12. git pull origin `your_branch_name`: Pulls changes from the remote repository into the specified branch.

13. git config --global user.name `your_branch_name`: set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history.

14. git config --global user.email `[valid-email]`:set an email address that will be associated with each history marker.
